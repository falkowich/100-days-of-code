## Week one

### Day 0: August 27, 2021

#### Planned Today

Split models into endpoint modules.

#### Today's Progress

Split done [66e3bb52](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/66e3bb52fbc5dfcd248053719fa70951e4e89149), started on moar-testing with pytest-async

#### Thoughts

Friday happiness at first, the split went as planned.  
Then... pytest and async made me somwhat frustrated.. So that is a tomorrow problem :)

### Day 1: August 28, 2021

#### Planned Today

Learn some more on pytest and tortoise-orm, and perhaps do some tests with auth user..

#### Today's Progress

Finally some kind of progress with testing on auth. [edadad8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/edadad8f565f02f6bece8633b8e3b2e9800f7881).  
Got some async testing experience too, But that is really messy (for me) :)

#### Thoughts

[*Some days are unicorn and rainbows. Unfortunately, today it's been wildbeest and shitstorms!*](https://twitter.com/falkowich/status/1109083297886470144/photo/1)  
I was almost going to throw in the gloves with pytest-async, httpx and tortoise-orm.. But things got better after a few hours..

### Day 2: August 29, 2021

#### Planned Today

Continue to get coverage on auth.  
Start getting coverage on manage.py  
Then merge into main
