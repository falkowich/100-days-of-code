## Things I want to..

### test out

- [ ] [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) - Full stack web apps with nothing but Python.
- [ ] [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) - Vue Native is a framework to build cross platform native mobile apps using JavaScript.

### learn more of

- [ ] [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Not only the 'helloWorld' example.
- [ ] [Software design guide - ArjanCodes](https://pages.arjancodes.com/designguide) - Start designing code before diving in to coding.

### work more on

- [pyise](https://github.com/falkowich/ise) - Python module to manage Cisco ISE via the REST API.

Moar here, soon :tm:

## 100days_of_code repos

Public things that I tried out and worked with when doing the "challange" 100days of code.

- [Sorta Simple Fastapi Template](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template)
- [cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

## Week 1

### Day 0: August 27, 2021

**Planned Today**

Split models into endpoint modules.

**Today's Progress**

Split done [66e3bb52](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/66e3bb52fbc5dfcd248053719fa70951e4e89149), started on moar-testing with pytest-async

**Thoughts**

Friday happiness at first, the split went as planned.  
Then... pytest and async made me somwhat frustrated.. So that is a tomorrow problem :)

### Day 1: August 28, 2021

**Planned Today**

Learn some more on pytest and tortoise-orm, and perhaps do some tests with auth user..

**Today's Progress**

Finally some kind of progress with testing on auth. [edadad8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/edadad8f565f02f6bece8633b8e3b2e9800f7881).  
Got some async testing experience too, But that is really messy (for me) :)

**Thoughts**

[*Some days are unicorn and rainbows. Unfortunately, today it's been wildbeest and shitstorms!*](https://twitter.com/falkowich/status/1109083297886470144/photo/1)  
I was almost going to throw in the gloves with pytest-async, httpx and tortoise-orm.. But things got better after a few hours..

### Day 2: August 29, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue to get coverage on auth.  
Start getting coverage on manage.py  
Then merge into main

**Today's Progress**

Merged api-tests in main, they are ugly.. But they are working.. sorta..  
[Merge pull request #8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/b616e84c31f06592a0dcc62391ddd0f29cc896a0)

**Thoughts**

Today was a short session, almost only an hour. Some scary stuff happened today and it was good to do some coding to clear my thougts.  
Testing is still hard to do for me, but slowely I perhaps can get the hang of it :)

### Day 3: August 30, 2021

**Planned Today**

Create a simple async cli script. Try to understand how to get codecov with pytest.

**Today's Progress**

Got some experience with pytest and cli testing..  
[https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

**Thoughts**

Again, slow progress with pytest and cli scripts.  
Lot's of googling and not so much coding :)

### Day 4: August 31, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with pytest and cli scripts, and perhaps go into async testing.  
[https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

**Today's Progress**

Got some more understanding with pytest and cli applications _argparse module_.  
There is much more to know, but the basics I think got stuck :)

**Thoughts**

Well, every evening I fire up code I havn't lost so much tempo as if I was doing it only once a week.  
So I guess that's a good thing. :)

### Day 5: September 01, 2021

**Planned Today**

Started codecov on manage.py. [PR](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/pull/9)

**Today's Progress**

Finally some understanding with pytest-async and Tortoise-ORM.  
It's really a can of worms when not used to async and pytest :)

**Thoughts**

Missed this, I did.. :)

### Day 6: September 02, 2021

**Planned Today**

Se what's needed to get som more experience with static typing. Check out mypy and dig deeper in pydantic outside FastAPI.  

**Today's Progress**

Nnothing real. Only reading documentation and turorials.

**Thoughts**

The normal (for me) non motivated aftereffect when finishing something planned.  
Where there are so many projects to do, I think it's always hard to choose what to pick and focus on that.

## Week 2

### Day 7: September 03, 2021

**Planned Today**

Getting an arduino running and testing some basic stuff

**Today's Progress**

Got things connected, a led to blink and some arduino code written.

**Thoughts**

It was not really my cup of tee I think.  Going to order some things to a RPi instead and see where that leads..

### Day 8: September 04, 2021

**Planned Today**

Getting started with a new project, that uses the template I been messing with the last week.

- Trying to get some order out of the chaos of thougts into some plans.
- Deciding if this is a doable thing.
  
**Today's Progress**

Refactored an repo Â» [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGGp_2gc5PY)  
Got selenium grid running in docker.  
Got python to use selenium-remote.  

**Thoughts**

Really fun to get everything up and running after some near misses.  
Continuing with this tomorrow. And perhaps create a public repo with "non sensitive" data.

### Day 9: September 05, 2021

**Planned Today**

Split a huge messt module into smaller files.
  
**Today's Progress**

Instead of doing as planned, I implemented @click cli functions.

**Thoughts**

@click was really easy to use.  
Everything felt logical, and tomorrow.. Doing the modulesplit :)

### Day 10: September 06, 2021

**Planned Today**

Split a huge messt module into smaller files. DO IT! :)
  
**Today's Progress**

Got it splitted up to smaller files.

**Thoughts**

The module is a mess, but atleast it is somewhat easier to read now.  
Perhaps it would be better to create a class, but that's for another day..

### Day 11: September 07, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue cleanup of module.  
Perhaps look into doing a class..  

**Today's Progress**

N/A real coding..

**Thoughts**

Tomorrow perhaps taking action of what's been learnded

### Day 12: September 07, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue cleanup of module.  
Perhaps look into doing a class..  

**Today's Progress**

N/A real coding..

**Thoughts**

Tomorrow perhaps taking action of what's been learnded

### Day 13: September 08, 2021

**Planned Today**

Pydantic learning

**Today's Progress**

Some testing with pydantic

**Thoughts**

Perhaps this time it stuck :)

## Week 3

### Day 14: September 09, 2021

**Planned Today**

More classes and pydantic

**Today's Progress**

Fixed the scraping in pydantic classes.

**Thoughts**

Today everything went really good.  
Pure fun to do something that isn't work related :)

### Day 15: September 10, 2021

**Planned Today**

Starting to use pydantic classes to push to api (Mockoon)

**Today's Progress**

POST serialized pydantic json to mockoon api.  
Tried out [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) for the fist time. Really easy to get running and it seems to have sane dafaults

**Thoughts**

Finally FRIDAY!  
After playing Minecraft with daughter[1], the weekend ended with a fine whiskey and few hours of code

### Day 16: September 11, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with API that stores the scraped data.

**Today's Progress**

Some skeleton building with tortiose models and pydantic schemas.

**Thoughts**

Tired as .... today. Nothing really was created unless models count :)  
Now, sleep. And hopefully less tired tomorrow.

### Day 17: September 12, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with API that stores the scraped data.

**Today's Progress**

NaN, only learning and reading up on "stuff"

**Thoughts**

Again, tired as ....  
Instead of creating, I am getting stuck at trying to understand and learning to "do right".  
But why not start, and learn while doing.  
Well, tomorrow it's a new week.

### Day 18: September 13, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with API that stores the scraped data. Take III

**Today's Progress**


**Thoughts**
