## Week one

### Day 0: August 27, 2021

#### Planned Today

Split models into endpoint modules.

#### Today's Progress

Split done [66e3bb52](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/66e3bb52fbc5dfcd248053719fa70951e4e89149), started on moar-testing with pytest-async

#### Thoughts

Friday happiness at first, the split went as planned.  
Then... pytest and async made me somwhat frustrated.. So that is a tomorrow problem :)

### Day 1: August 28, 2021

#### Planned Today

Learn some more on pytest and tortoise-orm, and perhaps do some tests with auth user..

#### Today's Progress

Finally some kind of progress with testing on auth. [edadad8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/edadad8f565f02f6bece8633b8e3b2e9800f7881).  
Got some async testing experience too, But that is really messy (for me) :)

#### Thoughts

[*Some days are unicorn and rainbows. Unfortunately, today it's been wildbeest and shitstorms!*](https://twitter.com/falkowich/status/1109083297886470144/photo/1)  
I was almost going to throw in the gloves with pytest-async, httpx and tortoise-orm.. But things got better after a few hours..

### Day 2: August 29, 2021

#### Planned Today

Continue to get coverage on auth.  
Start getting coverage on manage.py  
Then merge into main

#### Today's Progress

Merged api-tests in main, they are ugly.. But they are working.. sorta..  
[Merge pull request #8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/b616e84c31f06592a0dcc62391ddd0f29cc896a0)

#### Thoughts

Today was a short session, almost only an hour. Some scary stuff happened today and it was good to do some coding to clear my thougts.  
Testing is still hard to do for me, but slowely I perhaps can get the hang of it :)

### Day 3: August 30, 2021

#### Planned Today

Create a simple async cli script. Try to understand how to get codecov with pytest.

#### Today's Progress

Got some experience with pytest and cli testing..  
[https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

#### Thoughts

Again, slow progress with pytest and cli scripts.  
Lot's of googling and not so much coding :)

### Day 4: August 31, 2021

#### Planned Today

Continue with pytest and cli scripts, and perhaps go into async testing.  
[https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

#### Today's Progress

Got some more understanding with pytest and cli applications _argparse module_.  
There is much more to know, but the basics I think got stuck :)

#### Thoughts

Well, every evening I fire up code I havn't lost so much tempo as if I was doing it only once a week.  
So I guess that's a good thing. :)
