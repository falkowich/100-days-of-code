Moar here, soon :tm:

## 100days_of_code repos

Public things that I tried out and worked with when doing the "challange" 100days of code.

- [Sorta Simple Fastapi Template](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template)
- [cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

## Week 1

### Day 0: August 27, 2021

**Planned Today**

Split models into endpoint modules.

**Today's Progress**

Split done [66e3bb52](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/66e3bb52fbc5dfcd248053719fa70951e4e89149), started on moar-testing with pytest-async

**Thoughts**

Friday happiness at first, the split went as planned.  
Then... pytest and async made me somwhat frustrated.. So that is a tomorrow problem :)

### Day 1: August 28, 2021

**Planned Today**

Learn some more on pytest and tortoise-orm, and perhaps do some tests with auth user..

**Today's Progress**

Finally some kind of progress with testing on auth. [edadad8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/edadad8f565f02f6bece8633b8e3b2e9800f7881).  
Got some async testing experience too, But that is really messy (for me) :)

**Thoughts**

[*Some days are unicorn and rainbows. Unfortunately, today it's been wildbeest and shitstorms!*](https://twitter.com/falkowich/status/1109083297886470144/photo/1)  
I was almost going to throw in the gloves with pytest-async, httpx and tortoise-orm.. But things got better after a few hours..

### Day 2: August 29, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue to get coverage on auth.  
Start getting coverage on manage.py  
Then merge into main

**Today's Progress**

Merged api-tests in main, they are ugly.. But they are working.. sorta..  
[Merge pull request #8](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/commit/b616e84c31f06592a0dcc62391ddd0f29cc896a0)

**Thoughts**

Today was a short session, almost only an hour. Some scary stuff happened today and it was good to do some coding to clear my thougts.  
Testing is still hard to do for me, but slowely I perhaps can get the hang of it :)

### Day 3: August 30, 2021

**Planned Today**

Create a simple async cli script. Try to understand how to get codecov with pytest.

**Today's Progress**

Got some experience with pytest and cli testing..  
[https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

**Thoughts**

Again, slow progress with pytest and cli scripts.  
Lot's of googling and not so much coding :)

### Day 4: August 31, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with pytest and cli scripts, and perhaps go into async testing.  
[https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab](https://github.com/falkowich/cli-pytest-async-lab)

**Today's Progress**

Got some more understanding with pytest and cli applications _argparse module_.  
There is much more to know, but the basics I think got stuck :)

**Thoughts**

Well, every evening I fire up code I havn't lost so much tempo as if I was doing it only once a week.  
So I guess that's a good thing. :)

### Day 5: September 01, 2021

**Planned Today**

Started codecov on manage.py. [PR](https://github.com/falkowich/sorta-simple-fastapi-template/pull/9)

**Today's Progress**

Finally some understanding with pytest-async and Tortoise-ORM.  
It's really a can of worms when not used to async and pytest :)

**Thoughts**

Missed this, I did.. :)

### Day 6: September 02, 2021

**Planned Today**

Se what's needed to get som more experience with static typing. Check out mypy and dig deeper in pydantic outside FastAPI.  

**Today's Progress**

Nnothing real. Only reading documentation and turorials.

**Thoughts**

The normal (for me) non motivated aftereffect when finishing something planned.  
Where there are so many projects to do, I think it's always hard to choose what to pick and focus on that.

## Week 2

### Day 7: September 03, 2021

**Planned Today**

Getting an arduino running and testing some basic stuff

**Today's Progress**

Got things connected, a led to blink and some arduino code written.

**Thoughts**

It was not really my cup of tee I think.  Going to order some things to a RPi instead and see where that leads..

### Day 8: September 04, 2021

**Planned Today**

Getting started with a new project, that uses the template I been messing with the last week.

- Trying to get some order out of the chaos of thougts into some plans.
- Deciding if this is a doable thing.
  
**Today's Progress**

Refactored an repo » [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGGp_2gc5PY)  
Got selenium grid running in docker.  
Got python to use selenium-remote.  

**Thoughts**

Really fun to get everything up and running after some near misses.  
Continuing with this tomorrow. And perhaps create a public repo with "non sensitive" data.

### Day 9: September 05, 2021

**Planned Today**

Split a huge messt module into smaller files.
  
**Today's Progress**

Instead of doing as planned, I implemented @click cli functions.

**Thoughts**

@click was really easy to use.  
Everything felt logical, and tomorrow.. Doing the modulesplit :)

### Day 10: September 06, 2021

**Planned Today**

Split a huge messt module into smaller files. DO IT! :)
  
**Today's Progress**

Got it splitted up to smaller files.

**Thoughts**

The module is a mess, but atleast it is somewhat easier to read now.  
Perhaps it would be better to create a class, but that's for another day..

### Day 11: September 07, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue cleanup of module.  
Perhaps look into doing a class..  

**Today's Progress**

N/A real coding..

**Thoughts**

Tomorrow perhaps taking action of what's been learnded

### Day 12: September 07, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue cleanup of module.  
Perhaps look into doing a class..  

**Today's Progress**

N/A real coding..

**Thoughts**

Tomorrow perhaps taking action of what's been learnded

### Day 13: September 08, 2021

**Planned Today**

Pydantic learning

**Today's Progress**

Some testing with pydantic

**Thoughts**

Perhaps this time it stuck :)

## Week 3

### Day 14: September 09, 2021

**Planned Today**

More classes and pydantic

**Today's Progress**

Fixed the scraping in pydantic classes.

**Thoughts**

Today everything went really good.  
Pure fun to do something that isn't work related :)

### Day 15: September 10, 2021

**Planned Today**

Starting to use pydantic classes to push to api (Mockoon)

**Today's Progress**

POST serialized pydantic json to mockoon api.  
Tried out [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) for the fist time. Really easy to get running and it seems to have sane dafaults

**Thoughts**

Finally FRIDAY!  
After playing Minecraft with daughter[1], the weekend ended with a fine whiskey and few hours of code

### Day 16: September 11, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with API that stores the scraped data.

**Today's Progress**

Some skeleton building with tortiose models and pydantic schemas.

**Thoughts**

Tired as .... today. Nothing really was created unless models count :)  
Now, sleep. And hopefully less tired tomorrow.

### Day 17: September 12, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with API that stores the scraped data.

**Today's Progress**

NaN, only learning and reading up on "stuff"

**Thoughts**

Again, tired as ....  
Instead of creating, I am getting stuck at trying to understand and learning to "do right".  
But why not start, and learn while doing.  
Well, tomorrow it's a new week.

### Day 18: September 13, 2021

**Planned Today**

Continue with API that stores the scraped data. Take III

**Today's Progress**

Started with post to get the whole json from frontend.  
Refactored a few modules and splitted into more logical files.
Found this, and it will work beq the json is rather huge, and is behind an jwt token. So only the frontend script can push to that endpoint.

```python
from fastapi import Body, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.post('/test')
async def update_item(
        payload: dict = Body(...)
):
    return payload
```

**Thoughts**

Today the fun came back, and I got stuff done.
Tomorrow things getting put into pydantic classes.. I think :)

### Day 19: September 14, 2021

**Planned Today**

N/A - Worked all night with ...work stuff...

### Day 20: September 15, 2021

**Planned Today**

Get things in to the db.

**Today's Progress**

One hour of getting a huge dict into pydantic objects to prepare db insertion.

**Thoughts**

It's a pretty strange(huge) json object that is the payload, and that comes with new challanges.

## Week 4

### Day 21: September 16, 2021

**Planned Today**

Get things in to the db. cont...

**Today's Progress**

Good progress with getting pydantic validated objects written to db.

### Day 22: September 17, 2021

**Planned Today**

Check if data is inserted into db, then update.

**Today's Progress**

Started to create a diff function for new posts

**Thoughts**

Sadly work until 22, then whiskey and music when coding..  
Now at 00.25 logic is broekn :)

### Day 23: September 18, 2021

**Planned Today**

Create get single object with children.

**Today's Progress**

insert or update if exist function.  
started the get all and "id" function

When things goes as planned, writing code is really relaxing.  
The opposite of cybersecurity :)  
And now some time familytime.. The best times

**Planned Today**

Try to get debugging to work inside docker container with vscode

**Today's Progress**

Got it working with a simple "main.py" fastapi file.

Renamed repo, package and module to pyise-ers and pyiseers.  
Merged two PR's, and worked started working on two other.

**Thoughts**

Total chaos with namechange, module change and PR's.  
Namechange and modulechange with github and PyPi is under control, but I forgot that the PR's got broken when the modulename changed.
